# Starwars The Old Republic Private Server


This will be designed around a previous release that I intend to bring up to date.

Planned improvements:

  1. Adding the content from the current vanilla version of the game
  2. Changing the Database to use MySQL instead of MongoDB(for allowing better cross compatibility with other software such as websites)
  3. Later on potentually moving this thing from C# to C++ to ensure no need for dependancies such as .NET or MONO.
  4. Adding a Node.JS addition for further expanding content such as items, quests and powers(need to research later)
  5. Changing the client game to be more universal with other games on the same engine(for preperation with other projects)
